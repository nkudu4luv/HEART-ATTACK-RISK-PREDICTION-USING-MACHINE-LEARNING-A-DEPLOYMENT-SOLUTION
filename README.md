Overview
This project uses various machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on data attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular health indicators. The data has been analyzed using different classification algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and transformed to remove any missing values and outliers, making it suitable for machine learning models.
Feature Engineering: Key features are extracted, and dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied to improve model performance.
Machine Learning Models: The project includes the implementation of various machine learning algorithms like SVM, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression for heart disease prediction.
Evaluation Metrics: The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness in predicting heart disease.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from publicly available repositories such as UCI Machine Learning Repository and other relevant datasets. It contains data attributes such as:

Age
Sex
Chest pain type
Resting blood pressure
Serum cholesterol
Fasting blood sugar
Resting electrocardiographic results
Maximum heart rate achieved
Exercise induced angina
ST depression induced by exercise

Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
Install required packages:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, and install the required dependencies using pip:


Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project:

To run the project, use the following command:


Edit
python heart_disease_prediction.py
This will train the model and output the evaluation metrics for the different algorithms used.

Usage
After running the script, you will get the following outputs:

Model Performance: Evaluation metrics for each machine learning model (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Confusion Matrix: A visualization of the model's classification performance.
Predictions: The predicted results for new input data (heart disease risk).
Example
python
Copy
Edit
# Sample usage for predicting heart disease risk
age = 50
sex = 'male'
cholesterol = 240
blood_pressure = 140
# Add more feature values as required

prediction = model.predict([[age, sex, cholesterol, blood_pressure]])
print("Heart Disease Prediction:", prediction)
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions
Precision: Proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct
Recall: Proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recal
